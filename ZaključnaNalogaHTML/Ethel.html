            <br><p> Ethel Anderson was a character in the animated series Brickleberry. Ethel is an excellent and sexy park ranger with a terrible alcohol problem. She arrived at Brickleberry having been top ranger at Yellowstone. She was voiced by Kaitlin Olson during the first season, but due to scheduling conflicts Natasha Leggero has replaced her beginning with the second season premiere.

Background
Ethel is a ranger who is known mostly for her good looks. She was the top ranger at Yellowstone National Park and was transferred to Brickleberry in an effort to get the park back on track. Ethel also mentioned that she didn't finish college in "Old Wounds".

Ethel possesses extraordinary ranger skills learned while being raised by her adopted Native American parents, but her talents aren't overly exaggerated. Other skills she learned from her parents include splitting eights and downing numerous amounts of vodka in mere seconds without triggering her gag reflex.

The last part is probably not accurate anymore. Ethel has a twin sister named Lucy who received more attention than her. It's also known that Ethel knew her parents, given how they told her Santa loved Lucy more, because while Lucy got a real pony, Ethel only got a plastic one. Lucy also was able to find a successful, handsome husband. Ethel has never been able to find a man of her own during the show's course, and she has expressed her desire to have children. Steve has expressed having wanted to date her throughout the episode "Baby Daddy", and the mere fact that he was able to get Ethel drunk so he could have sex with her became the basis of his Broadway musical "I Fucked Ethel!", which drew a very large, successful attendance. Ethel even paid to see the musical, but then asked herself why she did so.

Ethel is very loving of animals (unless it's Malloy) being the only one of the main cast who is sensitive towards animals. She is very much infatuated with raising the wildlife of Brickleberry National Park, except in "Steve's Bald" she developed zoosadism and wanted to kill every animal in sight for fun, even pointing a gun at a baby fox's head to kill him off.

Personality
Ethel is a rebellious park ranger obsessed with protecting animals, women's rights and being treated fairly. She often clashes with most of the main cast calling them out for habits that she finds repulsive, such as Connie for begging for sex from her and Malloy for his never-ending insults of destroying self-esteem. Ethel is also very environmentally conscious and cares a lot about how healthy both plant and animal life is at Brickleberry.

Out of the four park rangers who is not the boss (Woody), Ethel is the most rebellious towards Woody since she's against Woody for his sick, demeaning behavior, especially regarding the episodes "Squabbits", "The Dam Show" and "My Way or the Highway".
