            <br><p>Connie Cunaman was a main character on the animated series Brickleberry. Connie is one of the six main characters, and is identified by her ugly appearance, being a lesbian, having incredible strength and being emotionally disturbed. She is voiced by show co-creator Roger Black, who is obviously a man, which is why she has such a deep manly voice.

BioEdit
Connie is a lesbian ranger who isn’t the most feminine woman around. The other rangers wonder about her sexuality, but everyone is afraid to ask because she could wrestle them all to the ground and choke the life out of them. Connie is unusually strong for a woman, which comes in handy when she has to wrestle a bear or drag a downed redwood off the road. Connie was born to be a park ranger. It's no secret she loves nature, but she's also in constant fear of "disrupting" the balance of the forest. She also trained to be a Navy Seal, but because of her love of Thanksgiving dinner, developed a weight problem, and dropped out. She later became a park ranger for some reason, most likely because being a park ranger requires heavy lifting for foliage and animals, and Connie's strength makes her the backbone of the park's lifting responsibilities. In fact, she is mostly set in charge of putting up heavy metallic trees under Woody's orders because Woody is covering up the fact that Brickleberry's vegetation is dying.

Connie is the show's most prominent character dealing with homosexuality. She became lesbian ever since being a young girl and became defamed by her parents and the "Jesus Hates Homosexuals Church". In "The Dam Show" and "Daddy Issues", Connie's tried asking out other women on a date, but has been turned down.

Don&#039;t be like connie
So disgusting!!
Connie is very fat thanks to her overeating habits. Although she's not the only overweight character out of the main cast, she gets the most fat shaming. She enjoys eating non-stop, having such a huge appetite. Woody used a picture of her eating as a brochure for Fat Camp, which depicted her chowing down on a gigantic submarine sandwich, pizza, burgers, and a milkshake all at once.

PersonalityEdit
It&#039;s 3 steps away!
Don't you ever, EVER hit Connie with a chair or your own fist or a baseball bat, you got that?!!! Use the Connie Club, that's what it's there for.
An emotionally unstable, overly attached lesbian is the best way to describe Connie. Connie panics a lot, and when she does panic, she runs out screaming hands up with her eyes closed (which of course makes her unable to see anything as she runs, leading to often times she just hits her head).

None of the main cast really show much respect for Connie, as they often make fun of her obesity, her ugliness and her gullibility. This often makes Connie depressed or outraged. Connie is very strong (which she attributes to her being a lesbian) and she has the power to tear apart people limb from limb. Connie is emotionally fragile. A recurring trait of her is that whenever she panics or falls into depression, she will run away and scream with her eyes closed while holding her hands up in the air, and if a park animal is in her path, she'll punch it.

Connie also seem to be clingy when it comes to having new friends. This can be best seen when Connie finds the Circus Freaks destruction of her cabin as a slumber party, and when she very easily joined a militia (but then she and the militia were too stupid to figure out what a militia is supposed to do).

Connie is dim-witted much like Steve. Her stupidity frustrates Denzel up to the point that he gains the desire to beat up or kill Connie.
Even if Connie is considered "sensitive" or "kind-hearted" sometimes, she often sexually harasses Ethel pressuring her to agree to have sex. Ethel claims that Connie has done so everyday, and that Connie is the only member of the Brickleberry Human Resources Department, so therefore Ethel can't do anything about it.
