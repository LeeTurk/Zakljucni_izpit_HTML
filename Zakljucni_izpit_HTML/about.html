        <h4>Brickleberry</h4>
    <p >Brickleberry was an American adult animated sitcom teen cartoon series that premiered on Comedy Central on September 25, 2012. The series was created by Roger Black and Waco O'Guin (creators of MTV2's Stankervision) and executive produced by Black, O'Guin and comedian Daniel Tosh. The series follows a group of park rangers as they work through their daily lives in the fictional Brickleberry National Park.

Black and O'Guin began pitching the show in the mid-2000s, producing a pilot episode for Fox Broadcasting Company in 2007. They later also pitched the show to Adult Swim, but the series was purchased by Comedy Central due to the support of Tosh.

On January 7, 2015, Comedy Central cancelled Brickleberry after three seasons.[1] The series ended on April 14, 2015, with a total of 36 episodes.
